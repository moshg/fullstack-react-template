## Debugging

When a test fails, first check if there are any discrepancies between the code being tested and the test code's expectations.

### Playwright

Playwright will timeout when the screen differs from what is expected.
For example, when trying to click a button with the following test code:

```typescript
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
```

If the actual button label on the screen is "Send", Playwright will not be able to find the button and a timeout error will occur:

```
TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
=========================== logs ===========================
waiting for getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })
============================================================
```

Anticipating this situation, verify that the button label on the actual screen matches what is expected in the test code.
