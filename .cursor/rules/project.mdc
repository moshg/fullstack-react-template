# Project Structure
## Technology Stack
- Runtime: Node.js
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Framework: React Router
- Components: shadcn/ui
- ORM: Drizzle ORM
- Forms: conform

# Library Notes
## React Router
This project uses React Router v7.
React Router v7 provides roughly the same functionality as Remix.
The module name is "react-router".

## shadcn/ui
When using components, always check if the required component exists in app/components.
If it doesn't exist, run `pnpx shadcn@latest add <component_name>` to add the component beforehand.
Do not use shadcn/ui's `Form` component. `Form` depends on react-hook-form, but we use conform as our form library.

## Drizzle ORM
The connection is in [drizzle.ts](mdc:app/config/drizzle.ts).
Schema information is in [schema.ts](mdc:app/db/schema.ts).

# Coding Conventions
- Use absolute imports except when accessing sibling directories. Absolute imports should be in the format `import { item } from "~/path/to/module"`.
