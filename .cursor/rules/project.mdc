# Documents
Be sure to read the following documents before starting work:

- Technology Stack section in [README.md](mdc:README.md)
- [specification.md](mdc:docs/specification.md)
- [directory-structure.md](mdc:docs/directory-structure.md)
- [error-handling.md](mdc:docs/error-handling.md)

# Library Notes
## React Router
This project uses React Router v7.
React Router v7 provides roughly the same functionality as Remix.
The module name is "react-router".

## shadcn/ui
When using components, always check if the required component exists in app/components.
If it doesn't exist, run `pnpx shadcn@latest add <component_name>` to add the component beforehand.
Do not use shadcn/ui's `Form` component. `Form` depends on react-hook-form, but we use conform as our form library.

## Drizzle ORM
Schema information is in [schema.ts](mdc:app/server/db/schema.ts).

## pg
Please use default import for the 'pg' module since it's a CommonJS module.

# Coding Conventions
- Use absolute imports except when accessing sibling directories. Absolute imports should be in the format `import { item } from "~/path/to/module"`.
